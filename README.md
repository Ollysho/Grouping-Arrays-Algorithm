# Grouping-Arrays-Algorithm
I created a javascript function that groups arrays, slightly by mistake but still.
This is the FreeCodeCamp algorithm that has taken me the longest to get done so far, I kept leaving it and then coming back to it trying to attack from a new area. What I learned from this one is try absolutely every and anything you can think of and hopefully maybe something will actually work.

This is the general basic rundown of what I had to do and I just couldn't figure out for the life of me how to create an empty array, and then create another array inside and put values in that.
At some point after trial an error I created this:

I'll admit it and say I actually got to here completely on accident and in my for loop the third part was "i + size" for the longest and it kept giving me an infinite loop warning until I figured it out. I actually had to ask a Javascript expert to explain my code and as it turns out, slice creates an entirely new array and then it pushes that array into the already existing "newArray", I thought it just pushed the values. The more you know I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Atleast my mild self loathing is gone for now.
